## Introduction:
  The rush to complete the syllabus in educational institutes affect the learning outcomes of the students. 5.8% of children reading in class five in government schools are not able to read the class two-level text. More than 70% of class eight students are unable to do the divisions correctly.
  In the year 2020 Education sector suffered a lot. We saw teachers conducting online classes but students barely got to learn something. 
  In this conditions, even with the NEP, will that benefit the students to grasp concepts and develop intuitive and analytical thinking?
 
## Solution:
  Edu-Eye tracks progress of the course of all the batches of a school and by graphical representations provides the overview of the course and also provides the     class's understanding of an unit of a course and hence help both teachers and students to grow and learn.
